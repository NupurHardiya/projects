                                              **DESKTOP VOICE ASSISTANT : JARVIS**

Jarvis is a simple Python program that can be used to control your computer using voice commands. The program can perform a variety of tasks, such as opening websites, playing music, searching Wikipedia, getting the time, opening code editors, and sending emails.

The objective of the code is to create a simple Python program that can be used to control a computer using voice commands. The program can perform a variety of tasks, such as opening websites, playing music, searching Wikipedia, getting the time, opening code editors, and sending emails.

The program works by first importing a few Python libraries that are necessary for its functionality. These libraries include pyttsx3, speech_recognition, datetime, wikipedia, webbrowser, os, smtplib, and pyaudio.

The program then defines a few functions that are used to perform specific tasks. For example, the speak() function is used to speak the given audio text, the wishMe() function is used to greet the user and introduce the program, the takeCommand() function is used to get a voice command from the user, and the sendEmail() function is used to send an email to the given recipient with the given content.

The program then enters a loop where it waits for the user to give a voice command. If the user gives a voice command, the program executes the corresponding task. For example, if the user says "open Google," the program will open the Google website in the user's web browser.

The program also includes a few error handling statements to handle situations where the user's voice command is not recognized or the program is unable to perform the requested task.

Overall, the code above is a simple but effective Python program that can be used to control a computer using voice commands. The program can be customized to perform a variety of tasks, and it can be easily extended to add new features.

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game where players take turns placing their symbols, X or O, in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.

1. **Two-player game**: The game is played between two players, who take turns placing their symbols on the game board.
2. **3x3 grid**: The game board is a 3x3 grid, with each square on the board representing a possible space for a player to place their symbol.
3. **Symbols**: The two players use different symbols to represent their turns. In this case, the players use the symbols X and O.
4. **Winning conditions**: The game is won by the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Draw**: If the game board is filled up with symbols and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
