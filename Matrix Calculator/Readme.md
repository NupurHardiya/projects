# Matrix Operations

This program performs various matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication.

## How to Use

1. Run the program: Compile and execute the `main` function in a C compiler.
2. Choose an operation: Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation from the operation menu.
3. Follow the prompts: Enter the required information for the chosen operation, such as matrix dimensions and elements.
4. View the result: The program will display the result of the selected operation.

## Operations

### Addition

- Adds two matrices of the same size together.
- Prompts the user to enter the dimensions and elements of the two matrices.
- Displays the sum of the two matrices.

### Subtraction

- Subtracts one matrix from another of the same size.
- Prompts the user to enter the dimensions and elements of the two matrices.
- Displays the difference between the two matrices.

### Scalar Multiplication

- Multiplies a matrix by a scalar value.
- Prompts the user to enter the scalar value and the dimensions and elements of the matrix.
- Displays the result of the scalar multiplication.

### Matrix Multiplication

- Multiplies two matrices together.
- Prompts the user to enter the dimensions and elements of the two matrices.
- Displays the product of the two matrices.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run the program.
